# Goal
Basic Idea is to create open source product/tool which can automatically find faults and its type in different HVAC using Machine Learning Methodologies. This idea was published as a research paper and also accepted in a conference. Novelity and LIterature review is done to prove how idea is new and not being implemented before and it's use in today's condition.
